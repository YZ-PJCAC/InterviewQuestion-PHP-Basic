here is the answer question
question 1: Update employee_no to job =4, with effective date 2020-01-01
UPDATE employee_job_table ej
JOIN employee_profile_table ep ON ej.employee_id = ep.employee_id
SET ej.job_id = 4, ej.effective_date = '2020-01-01'
WHERE ep.employee_no = 1002;

/* question 1 above
join table employee profile to employee job table, make employee id as column. 
update job id to 4 and effective date to 2020-01-01, effect on who employee no = 1002.
*/


question 2: List out the employee name, employee no, effective date, job title
SELECT ep.employee_name, ep.employee_no, ej.effective_date, jp.job_name
FROM employee_job_table ej
JOIN employee_profile_table ep ON ej.employee_id = ep.employee_id
JOIN job_profile_table jp ON ej.job_id = jp.job_id;

/* question 2 above
select specific column from table employee job, employee profile and job profile.
ensure data employee job and employee profile match using employee_id .
ensure data employee job and job profile match using job profile job_id
display employee name, employee no, effective date, job title
*/


question 3: List out the employee name, employee no, latest job title
SELECT ep.employee_name, ep.employee_no, jp.job_name
FROM employee_job_table ej
JOIN employee_profile_table ep ON ej.employee_id = ep.employee_id
JOIN job_profile_table jp ON ej.job_id = jp.job_id
WHERE ej.effective_date = (
    SELECT MAX(effective_date)
    FROM employee_job_table ej2
    WHERE ej2.employee_id = ej.employee_id
);

/* question 3 above
select specific column from table employee profile, job profile.
from employee_profile_table get employee details, match by employee_id from employee job and employee profile. 
from job profile table get job title. match employee job and job profile table by job id
filter data and latest effective date. select max(effective date) is most newest for each employee id
*/

question 4: delete all employee with employee_no 1000 job title, with effective date of 2020-01-01
DELETE ej
FROM employee_job_table ej
JOIN employee_profile_table ep ON ej.employee_id = ep.employee_id
WHERE ep.employee_no = 1000 AND ej.effective_date = '2020-01-01';

/* question 4 above
delete specific data. join table employee profile with employee job to find employee no. 
only records of the employee with employee_no = 1000 and specified effective date are affected.
